## Hi there 👋

Hello, I am Saki, rhythm game enthusiast, retro fan, and Computer Science student with a hobby for romhacking and reverse engineering.

### 💻 Technical Knowledge

- I like working in C, sometimes under constraint (C89, C99). I am familiar with [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) for developing small games and programs that require audio, video, key input management and more. Also trying to learn [Allegro 4](https://github.com/Sakimotor/allegoro_and_stuff) in hopes to make a game that'd run on MS-DOS machines someday;
- I know Assembly for the x86-64 (AT&T style), ARM, LC-3 and MIPS (mostly the way it's used on the Sony Playstation 1) architectures. I debug software with gdb or x96dbg whenever needed;
- I often make small scripts with Python, mainly treating it like a cross-platform version of the Linux Shell, although I also happen to appreciate the ease of use of its' file reading/writing features. Used most notably in my [TGM: Ace English Translation](https://github.com/Sakimotor/tgma_eng) to edit the game's executable, as well as in the [Magical Date English Translation](https://gitlab.com/Sakimotor/magical-date) to rebuild the game's .BIN archives after editing them (necessary when one of files inside said archive becomes taller than before and offsets everything else);
- I can develop very basic GUI Interfaces in Java (Swing/AWT), and Python (Qt5), as shown in my [Silver Case Parser](https://github.com/Sakimotor/The-Silver-Parser);
- I can make a basic website in HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and connect it to an SQL (MariaDB) database. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) is my favorite local environment to test the site out before deploying it publicly.

  Other languages I know but don't have enough projects to show for would be OCaml, C++ and Visual Basic for Access.

### 🔍 Miscellaneous Knowledge

- I speak French and English fluently.
- Although it's my native language, my Russian is a bit rusty (B2 level with many grammatical mistakes)...
- Trying to (re)learn German;
- I like softmodding the hardware I own in my free time, and would like to learn enough soldering/tinkering skills to become a hardmodder.


### 🎮 Trivia

- During my free time, I attempt to get closer to the World Record in the Arcade game [Radiant Silvergun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnuy1fdG3A);
- I also like rhythm games, such as Beatmania (and IIDX), DanceDanceRevolution, and some obscurities like PacaPacaPassion;
- Tetris is another series I fancy spending time on, especially the Grand Master episodes by Arika.

  I love attending arcades, chances are we've met before if you're around Paris and attend places such as Extra Life Café, Nikito, Game On or La Tête Dans Les Nuages.
